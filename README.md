We are going to create a fun dice game. <br/> <br/>

## Rules:
1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. 
2. In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he
wishes.
3. Each result will get added to his round’s score.<br/>
But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score
gets lost.
After that, it's the next player’s turn.
4. A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his
round’s score gets added to his global score.
5. After that, it's the next player's turn. <br/> <br/>
6. The first player to pass predefined score points loose. <br/> <br/>
7. The first player to reach predefined score exactly wins. <br/>
8. Add an input field where players can set the winning
score to change the predefined score up to 100. 
9. Players can create a new game whenever they want to.
