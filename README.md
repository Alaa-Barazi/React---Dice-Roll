<br/>

Rules: <br/>
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
<br/> 
In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he
wishes.
<br/> <br/>
Each result will get added to his round’s score.<br/>
But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score
gets lost.
<br/> <br/>
After that, it's the next player’s turn.
<br/>
A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his
round’s score gets added to his global score.
<br/>
After that, it's the next player's turn. <br/> <br/>
The first player to pass predefined score points loose. <br/> <br/>
The first player to reach predefined score exactly wins. <br/>
Add an input field where players can set the winning
score to change the predefined score up to 100. <br/>
Players can create a new game whenever they want to.
